            </h3>
            <p>
                Clients are no longer looking for a ’one stop shop’ across the spectrum and go to
                ‘specialists’ for distinct hiring needs. For example, while ‘speed’ and ‘numbers’
                may be the mantra for mass hiring; the top end of the market is driven by ‘industry
                expertise’ and ‘the ability to engage’. We have distinct brands to address each
                segment to best address specific client needs.
